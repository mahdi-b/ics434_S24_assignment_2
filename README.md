# Assignment 2
* Assignment 2  is due on 2/29. 

The goal of this assignment is to practice some essential probability and hypothesis testing sections. The assignment consists of two parts: 1- generative models and simulation; and 2- data analysis, interpretation and hypothesis testing. In both problems, you are given bits of information that guide you through solving the problem step-by-step before you are asked to repeat the analysis on a different question.
